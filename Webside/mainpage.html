                    <p>I'm a single mother of two teenagers and it's very important to me that they eat healthy quality food. With our membership at Tasty&Fancy they can easily order takeaway or even eat in the restaurant if they want to. I know the staff of Tasty&Fancy will take good care of my kids. </p>

                    <h2>Michelin rated, Three Stars.</h2>
                    <p>With their new masterchef Sierra Karlson on board, Tasty&Fancy reopened with a completely new vision. They now offer "comfort-quality gourmet food" in their restaurant and for takeaway. The Masterchef Sierra Karlson told us that she always envisioned herself making gourmet food out of wellknown "comfort-food" dishes like mac&cheese, nachos, pancakes, etc and that she is very proud that her restaurant got rewarded with three Michelin stars. "I love that all kinds of people enjoy my food and that the restaurant got such a broad specter of people visiting." Quote, Sierra Karlson. "The Oslo Times, 2O14..." </p>
